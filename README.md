# Code Publishing

Utility for publishing code articles in a manner similar to [CodeProject](https://www.CodeProject.com)

[CodeProject](https://www.CodeProject.com) is presently out of business and the articles are only accessible on a read-only basis.
This facility is being developed to compensate for the lack of this valuable resource.

The code highlighter is based on Craig Campbell's [Rainbow](https://github.com/ccampbell/rainbow). Most of the code is radically rewritten and greatly simplified. Node support was found defunct and is removed. Separate pieces of code
have been rewritten using more modern JavaScript, and multiple problems have been solved.
